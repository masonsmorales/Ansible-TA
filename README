To use this TA, you must configure the log_path in your ansible.cfg. The path MUST be readable by Splunk. For example:

[defaults]
log_path=/var/log/ansible.log

Additionally, if you are running splunk as a non-privileged user (which you should be), be sure to give the splunk user access to /var/log/ansible.log and add a post-rotate script to ensure splunk's file ACL permissions persist after the file is rotated by logrotate. Examples below. Note that in the post-rotate script, we are giving the splunk user access to all of /var/log. You can be more restrictive than this if needed in your environment, but this makes it easy for Splunk to read other log files on the system as well.

sudo touch /etc/logrotate.d/splunk_facls
sudo echo "{" | sudo tee --append /etc/logrotate.d/splunk_facls
sudo echo "    postrotate" | sudo tee --append /etc/logrotate.d/splunk_facls
sudo echo "        /usr/bin/setfacl -m u:splunk:rx -R /var/log/" | sudo tee --append /etc/logrotate.d/splunk_facls
sudo echo "    endscript" | sudo tee --append /etc/logrotate.d/splunk_facls
sudo echo "}" | sudo tee --append /etc/logrotate.d/splunk_facls
# Force the splunk_facls logscript to run once now to update FACL permissions. It will automatically run after logrotate in the future.
sudo logrotate -vf /etc/logrotate.d/splunk_facls

Note: You should now have the following file in /etc/logrotate.d/splunk_facls
{
    postrotate
        /usr/bin/setfacl -m u:splunk:rx -R /var/log/
    endscript
}
